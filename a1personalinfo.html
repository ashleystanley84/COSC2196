Flash back to the early 90, internet was in its infancy. My dad had a friend that was into these computer things. The friend would play around with them, pull them apart, build them. My dad always had an interest and his friend offered to put something together for him to learn and play around with. Looking back it definitely wasn’t anything special, noisy fans in a striking cream box, but the most memorable thing was the monitor. It was 2 colours, black and green, ran on DOS without a GUI and only a command prompt. I always found it compelling and would always wonder how it worked, how did typing on the keyboard invoke a response on the screen and once I began to learn a little bit I became hooked with computers and technology. The next iteration received a windows 3.1 upgrade accompanied with a colour monitor, I was mind blown. The system got a few basic upgrades but I starkly remember the computer being so lacking that to even load up something like the original Duke Nukem the system needed to be restarted in DOS prompt to muster enough resources for the application to load.
Through the years we got new computers and the versions of everything slowly updated. I eventually was able to save up via some casual work and purchase my own computer with a TNT2 GPU and later upgraded to a voodoo 5, as a teenager I was an envy of others when you rocked up to a LAN party with a voodoo 5 equipped system. Lots of fond memories and sleepless nights.

Technology was always a big part of my growing up, but at some point I changed, pressures of being old enough to party and starting a family I moved away from computer technology and moved my interest elsewhere. It wasn’t till about 9 or so years ago when an old friend was upgrading their system and they gave me their old gaming PC. I got hooked again, pulled it apart upgraded it, gutted the case and re-envisioned it several times over. From then computers and tech have become a source of enjoyment. Many years ago I would play around with building website basics, but the interests moved from not just PC’s but to things like camera and phones. And all the while needing to know how everything worked on the inside and behinds the scene.

I fell into a work grove and began getting management opportunities so any thought of an IT career seemed like a different life direction and that I believed I couldn’t be capable of being successful like all the people I knew or heard about. But why cant I was an epiphany of just recently, my kids are older and growing, and my work is stale. I still need to work for another 30 years of my life, I would prefer doing this than my Management job. I did some self learning and now enrolled in university for the first time in my life. I can do this.
</p>

<p style="font-family:arial" align="justify">
Why was RMIT my choice of learning, the flexibility . Being capable of learning completely at my home around the life pressures of work and family in an environment I can choose the time to study. The world has changed a lot with how we do things and the changes to how people learn has sparked a confidence that I can achieve something I could not have with traditional learning.
</p>

<p style="font-family:arial" align="justify">
Pulling all my personal knowledge of IT and choosing to learn of my own accord is a fun way to discover things, when trying to find a direction and learn what the industry is doing. Self learning leaves a lot of gaps in really knowing what the industry direction is. What am I looking to get out of this degree is simple an all encompassing overall understanding of all facets that drive the IT industries. Where I specialize in I am not sure, but the more I learn the more intriguing I find subjects and topics, but it is also a way for me to work out what I am most good at, I am enjoying programming, I enjoy the hardware aspects, IT management roles. So many opportunities, I am excited to see what sparks me.

Full Stack Development Specialist. What is full stack? A full stack developer is a technologies expert and a jack of all trades and specialising in web development, they can handle all the work of system engineering, servers, databases and client services. So essentially someone who can work on the back end, the front end and client side, they know how each layer functions and can manipulate all the backend components.
</p>
<p style="font-family:arial" align="justify">
Full stack developers are highly valued by small start ups and large companies alike and have a broad set of skills and extensive knowledge of the server side and client side of the development process.
</p>
<p style="font-family:arial" align="justify">
Skills necessary to be a successful full stack developer are front end languages like HTML, CSS, Java script. Backend languages like PHP, python, ruby and java. Understand the web architecture to create complex software applications. Data base storage etc. There can be years of experience required to become successful and understand all facets required to be competent in the full stack role.
</p>
<p style="font-family:arial" align="justify">
Where do I fit into this ideal role at this stage? The skills I can bring to this role at currently is quite limited. Besides some small experience with HTML, python and java I have a lot to learn. The concept of an ideal job is a great way of understanding the needs required to fulfill the roles expectations. Although I have a lot to learn in the prospects of becoming a full stack engineering specialist it helps steer me towards the technologies I need to understand and continue my development needed.
</p>
<p style="font-family:arial" align="justify">
Ultimately the move into Information Technology can be bold and daunting. Coming from a background of IT for fun and interest I have a lot of developmental gaps and I am starting to identify the needs for development. Ideally where to I start? Well, this Bachelor of IT. This is designed to give me a catchup of all current IT arenas and broadly the technologies implemented within the industry. Following this I would be interested in dialled down courses that may narrow down the key technologies and web architectures needed to be successful in this type of role. From there ideally gain work within the IT industry and use this as an on the job tool for learning and development.
