  What do these results mean for me?
</h4>
<p style="font-family:arial" align="justify">
  Based on the results displayed I can definitely agree with a lot of the traits 16 personalities identified and how they align with my personal review. Based on personal life experiences I did at one stage contemplate a career in counselling or phycology but found I would be more prone to mental burn out from personally carrying burdens. Due to my creative natures my desire to learn, plan and implement my current choices of career and prospect career paths align with these desires and traits.
</p>
<p style="font-family:arial" align="justify">
  Based on my personal experience thew learning style assessment from education planner.org assesses quite accurately and describes the way I learn and process information visualizing. Auditory is a secondary but even when directions are verbalized I find myself converting the verbal queues and imagining them visually to process information. And the creativity test from MindTools seems to align to my experiences and how I problem solve and think creatively, I generally plan for the worse case scenario aim to process through problems and generate solutions timely before problems arise but still capable to think quick and put out fires as they start.

    Influencing behavior in a team and consideration when forming groups
  </h4>
</h4>
<p style="font-family:arial" align="justify">
  When reviewing these results and referring to my current job path. Being a leader, collaborator and problem solver in my current work role in management helps me be versatile with different groups and types of people. I can take charge, equally input and listen and compromise and collaborate to be an asset in decision making in a team environment. The results more accurately reflect my characteristics and reality better than I believed the outcomes I expected. I think when forming a team these results assist in team forming more an understanding of different profiles and understanding how to all work together to reach outcomes and amicable resolution.
