Full Stack Development Specialist. What is full stack? A full stack developer is a technologies expert and a jack of all trades and specialising in web development, they can handle all the work of system engineering, servers, databases and client services. So essentially someone who can work on the back end, the front end and client side, they know how each layer functions and can manipulate all the backend components.
</p>
<p style="font-family:arial" align="justify">
Full stack developers are highly valued by small start ups and large companies alike and have a broad set of skills and extensive knowledge of the server side and client side of the development process.
</p>
<p style="font-family:arial" align="justify">
Skills necessary to be a successful full stack developer are front end languages like HTML, CSS, Java script. Backend languages like PHP, python, ruby and java. Understand the web architecture to create complex software applications. Data base storage etc. There can be years of experience required to become successful and understand all facets required to be competent in the full stack role.
</p>
<p style="font-family:arial" align="justify">
Where do I fit into this ideal role at this stage? The skills I can bring to this role at currently is quite limited. Besides some small experience with HTML, python and java I have a lot to learn. The concept of an ideal job is a great way of understanding the needs required to fulfill the roles expectations. Although I have a lot to learn in the prospects of becoming a full stack engineering specialist it helps steer me towards the technologies I need to understand and continue my development needed.
</p>
<p style="font-family:arial" align="justify">
Ultimately the move into Information Technology can be bold and daunting. Coming from a background of IT for fun and interest I have a lot of developmental gaps and I am starting to identify the needs for development. Ideally where to I start? Well, this Bachelor of IT. This is designed to give me a catchup of all current IT arenas and broadly the technologies implemented within the industry. Following this I would be interested in dialled down courses that may narrow down the key technologies and web architectures needed to be successful in this type of role. From there ideally gain work within the IT industry and use this as an on the job tool for learning and development.
