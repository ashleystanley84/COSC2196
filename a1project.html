  Accessibility to information in the modern world has never been easier. We have mobile phones where we can store mobile numbers, google to research any topic or potential services. Most people in the modern world find these tasks of navigating information and services simple and easy on the internet. But for some this task of searching for services is not quite as easy for some as it is for other.
</p>
<p style="font-family:arial" align="justify">
  My Project idea was stirred on because of an elderly relative, who has been shown before, but still remains scared off contacting a business or services so instead becomes flustered and avoids the situation all because they don’t trust the information is correct or even how to find what they are looking for. But not only for elderly, the concept would be beneficial to children who are just starting to understand technology and for people travelling abroad in places they are not familiar.
</p>
<p style="font-family:arial" align="justify">
  My idea is a location based phone book as a simple description. A phone app or website that uses location services to provide the best contacts for business’ and services depending on specific locations. For example, if an elderly person was visiting a friend in a different town and needed to contact the police station. Not an emergency situation but potentially to report something, once familiar with the app they can open the app and just select police station and it will call the police station closest to their current location. Or if travelling abroad and an incident occurs and they need to find the closest medical centre. The app can provide specific information about address and specific contact number to the service closest toy where you are.
</p>
<p style="font-family:arial" align="justify">
  One article from PRNewswire a survey of 2,700 people aged 55 and over surveyed worldwide via telephone indicated that of the participants, 42% use the internet regular, 31% occasionally and 27% never. Then asked a series of questions the reasons why respondents do not use the internet, 59% said they do not need it, 42% said it was too complicated, 37% rely on family and friends if they need to do something online, 36% feel too old and 15% just flat out reject the internet. And all the while of these respondents 27% live by themselves alone.
</p>
<p style="font-family:arial" align="justify">
  Aging in place website said from a recent study from the Pew Research Centre found amongst seniors 65 and over, 85% own cell phones with 46% regularly using smartphones.

<p style="font-family:arial" align="justify">
  How would an App like this look and how would it function. It needs to be simple and bold, especially if it has a specific target audience may be the elderly with the viability of additional uses like travel accessibility or children with simple technology understanding, but with its primary function being a locations based service capable of retrieving current location information itemised down to services specific you where you are at the time.
</p>
<p style="font-family:arial" align="justify">
  The visualisation of how users would navigate the App would be more around categories, ie a selectable button with emergency services that list the likes of police station, fire station, medical centres, hospital but also emergency numbers as the vary from country to country. Other categories for example could be food that pulls local data, imagine ordering a pizza from well know pizza chain and the specific number for the local comes up. The possibilities are endless but it needs to figure out how to filter out as not to overwhelm with too many possibilities and potentially just display the most relevant and reputable services. Databasing limitless business would be time consuming and near impossible and may require some kind of machine learning to track through postcodes via the internet and retrieve and store the information data and recall information this way.
</p>
<p style="font-family:arial" align="justify">
  Another potential option could be to ability to itemise services via proximity from a service like google maps etc, which would potentially still require some sophisticated technology to read, sort, rate services. This option would seem more viable as when services details change the data displayed would correlate and display up to date information.
</p>
<p style="font-family:arial" align="justify">
  What kind of tools and technology would be required to create an app like this? Well the phone would definitely need to have a GPS module and assisted GPS to articulate locations as well as cellular ID. Geofencing technologies for the app to create virtual boundaries, the geofencing technique is employed by companies like uber. And one of the most important technologies being the likes of Google maps and ‘Places API’ where the app can pull data based on geolocations.
</p>
<p style="font-family:arial" align="justify">
  As for programming languages Java, Swift, Kotlin, Python. And development software the likes of appypie, skuid, linx.
</p>
<p style="font-family:arial" align="justify">
  Naturally the skills required to execute the development of a sophisticated app like this that would rely on geolocation would need firm understanding of programming in choice programming languages and the ability to integrate the services allowing the functionality of geolocation services. The ability to execute an app would be a venture requiring a team with varying skills and knowledge to draw the capability to pull the project together and viably something for a bigger organisation to accomplish.
</p>
<p style="font-family:arial" align="justify">
  If a project of this magnitude was achievable the difference it may make may only be to a small demographic that is unable to navigate the likes of search engines or even out of convenience, but like everything in IT it’s a numbers game. When there is an app that has worldwide relevance the proportion of the population that would find this service useful could be millions and would need continuous upkeep and development to keep up to date and remain relevant.
